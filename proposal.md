## Case Title
CVAI Turbo

## Background
Many students find it challenging to adapt their CVs and cover letters to specific job applications. Doing so requires strong writing skills and the ability to emphasize the most relevant experiences. An AI-powered tool can help students by creating customized cover letter.

## Purpose
This project is to develop a prototype of an AI-based tool that assists students, by taking their CV, job application and instructions as input. The tool will then generate customized cover letter.

## Target Users
For university and college students applying for internships or part-time jobs, as well as for adademic institutions seeking to better support students in their career.

  - Sub-part of CV is a profile.
  - A textbox where the user can put instructions (here option for style and tone).
- Create update, delete job application
  - Job advertisement as plain text
- Cover letter will be generated by third party LLM.
