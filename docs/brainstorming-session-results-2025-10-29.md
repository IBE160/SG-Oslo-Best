**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** BIP

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** LLM Opportunities for CVAI Turbo

**Session Goals:** Discuss the opportunities to have LLM in my application

**Techniques Used:** "What If" Scenarios, Mind Mapping

**Total Ideas Generated:** 12

### Key Themes Identified:

- Core Generation
- Content & Strategy
- User Interaction
- New Formats & Outputs
- Career Coaching

## Technique Sessions

### "What If" Scenarios

We explored three "what if" scenarios to push the boundaries of the initial idea:
1.  **What if the LLM could do more than just write a cover letter?** This led to ideas about providing feedback, examples, and language translation.
2.  **What if the LLM could analyze more than just the CV and the job ad?** This generated ideas about a conversational interface to gather more personal information and the importance of security.
3.  **What if the "CVAI Turbo" wasn't just a tool, but a personal career coach?** This expanded the vision to include professional presentation advice, content strategy, and innovative formats.

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities

_Ideas ready to implement now_

- Generate customized cover letters (MVP).
- Provide feedback on how to improve a cover letter.
- Suggest which qualifications to highlight or de-emphasize.
- Give examples of other relevant job applications.
- Provide suggestions on style and tone.
- Use a conversational interface (chatbot) to get to know the user.
- Implement a "talk-to-text" feature where the user can speak their thoughts and the AI will formalize them.
- Suggest alternative presentation formats (e.g.plain text).
- Export information in a presentation-friendly format.
- Provide advice on how to present professionally.
- Act as a personal career coach, guiding the user through the application process.

## Reflection and Follow-up

### What Worked Well

The "What If" scenarios were effective in expanding the initial vision and generating a wide range of ideas.

### Areas for Further Exploration

The technical feasibility and implementation details of a conversational interface and a local LLM warrant further investigation.

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

- **Prototyping:** Create low-fidelity prototypes of the conversational interface to test with users.
- **Technical Spike:** Investigate the options for using a local or private LLM.

### Questions That Emerged

- How can we ensure the security and privacy of user data in a conversational context?
- What are the technical requirements for implementing a "talk-to-text" feature?

### Next Session Planning

- **Suggested topics:** Prioritizing the generated ideas and creating a product roadmap.
- **Recommended timeframe:** Next week.
- **Preparation needed:** Review the brainstorming results and come with initial thoughts on priorities.
