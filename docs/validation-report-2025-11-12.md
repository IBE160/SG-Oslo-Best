# Validation Report

**Document:** docs/PRD.md
**Checklist:** bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/prd/checklist.md
**Date:** 2025-11-12T10:00:00Z

## Summary
- **Overall: 0/85 passed (0%)**
- **Critical Issues: 1**

**CRITICAL FAILURE: The validation has failed because the provided document `docs/PRD.md` is an unfilled template.**

## Section Results

### 1. PRD Document Completeness
**Pass Rate: 0/13 (0%)**

- [✗] **FAIL** - All core sections contain unfilled template variables (e.g., `{{vision_alignment}}`, `{{product_magic_essence}}`). The document is not populated with project-specific information.

### All Other Sections
**Pass Rate: 0/72 (0%)**

- All other validation checks could not be performed because the document is a template.

## Failed Items

- **[CRITICAL] ✗ Template variables unfilled:** The entire document consists of placeholder variables. It must be filled with actual requirements before validation can occur.

## Recommendations

1.  **Must Fix:** The `PRD.md` document needs to be completed by filling in all the template variables with the specific details of your project.
2.  **Next Step:** Once the PRD is complete, please run this validation task again.
