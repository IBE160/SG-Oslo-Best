# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-10-27
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** BIP

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** CVAI Turbo Project Possibilities

**Session Goals:** To explore possibilities within the CVAI Turbo proposal, identify root causes of student challenges, and brainstorm potential features.

**Techniques Used:** Five Whys, What If Scenarios

**Total Ideas Generated:** 3 core features for MVP, 2 future features, 1 moonshot (plus root cause analysis)

### Key Themes Identified:

*   **Simplicity and MVP Focus:** Strong emphasis on a lean, easy-to-use core product for the initial release.
*   **Bridging the Gap:** The underlying problem identified – students' difficulty translating academic knowledge into job market relevance – is the core challenge the tool aims to address.
*   **Future-Proofing:** Clear vision for advanced features and monetization, indicating a scalable product roadmap.

## Technique Sessions

### Five Whys

*   **Initial Problem:** Students find it challenging to adapt CVs and cover letters.
*   **Root Cause:** Students struggle to translate their theoretical academic knowledge into practical skills and language relevant to the job market. This stems from a lack of experience, guidance, and understanding of how their studies apply professionally.

### What If Scenarios

*   **"Translation Report" Feature:** Explored the idea of a detailed report showing CV-to-job-ad relevance. User feedback indicated this is a valuable **Future Innovation** due to the focus on MVP simplicity.
*   **"Suggest Skills to Highlight/De-emphasize" Feature:** Discussed simple ways to guide users, such as integrating templates or examples. This aligns with the **Immediate Opportunities** for simple guidance.
*   **"Interview Talking Points" Feature:** Identified as a "really cool" **Future Innovation** for later development.

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities

_Ideas ready to implement now_

*   Create, update, delete for CV (plain text) with a profile and an instructions textbox (for style and tone).
*   Create, update, delete job application (plain text job advertisement).
*   Cover letter generation by a third-party LLM.

### Future Innovations

_Ideas requiring development/research_

*   "Interview talking points" feature to help students prepare for interviews.

### Moonshots

_Ambitious, transformative concepts_

*   Payment opportunities and subscription for having access to exclusive features.

### Insights and Learnings

_Key realizations from the session_

*   The "CVAI Turbo" tool is fundamentally a "translator" for students, helping them articulate their value in a professional context.
*   Simple guidance through templates and examples is highly valued for user experience.
*   Strong user emphasis on MVP simplicity and adherence to the KISS principle.

## Action Planning

### Top 1 Priority Idea

#### #1 Priority: Set up the foundational backend and database infrastructure.

- Rationale: Establishes core data storage and user management, which are prerequisites for building out the CV and job application CRUD functionalities and, ultimately, the cover letter generation.
- Next steps:
    - Initialize the FastAPI project.
    - Configure Supabase (setting up user authentication and initial database tables for user profiles, CVs, and job applications).
    - Implement basic user authentication.
- Resources needed: Development team, Supabase account, FastAPI knowledge.
- Timeline: Initial phase of development.

## Reflection and Follow-up

### What Worked Well

The "Five Whys" technique was highly effective in identifying the root cause of the student's challenges, reframing the core problem the tool aims to solve. The "What If Scenarios" helped in exploring feature possibilities and clarifying MVP scope.

### Areas for Further Exploration

Further detailed planning for the "Immediate Opportunities" (MVP features) to break down each into smaller, manageable tasks.

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

A more structured planning technique, such as a feature breakdown or user story mapping, would be beneficial for the next steps.

### Questions That Emerged

How will the LLM be integrated to ensure consistent and high-quality cover letter generation while adhering to the "simple" principle?

### Next Session Planning

- **Suggested topics:** Detailed planning for MVP features, LLM integration strategy.
- **Recommended timeframe:** Soon, to maintain momentum.
- **Preparation needed:** Review of this brainstorming summary and technical specifications.
