---

## 2. What Went Well (Successes)

*   **Strong Foundational Setup:** The team successfully established the monorepo structure, Next.js frontend, and FastAPI backend, forming a solid technical base for the project.
*   **Robust Supabase Integration:** The Supabase integration was implemented effectively, and a robust connection validation mechanism was put in place.
*   **Effective Review Process:** The Senior Developer Review process (led by BIP) was efficient in catching and resolving issues promptly, such as the extraneous `express` dependency in Story 1.1 and the Supabase connection validation in Story 1.2.
*   **Pragmatic Decision-Making:** The team made a pragmatic decision to adapt to the external blocker for Story 1.3 by prioritizing local functionality, ensuring continued progress.
*   **Confidence in Internal Codebase:** The team expressed satisfaction with the quality and stability of the internal code written so far.

---

## 3. What Didn't Go Well (Challenges / Areas for Growth)

*   **Over-reliance on External Factors:** The project experienced significant slowdowns and a blocked story (1.3 CI/CD) due to external dependencies (e.g., repository ownership for Vercel deployment).
*   **Verification Gap for External Integrations:** Difficulty in fully verifying deployment-related Acceptance Criteria due to limitations in accessing or controlling external systems (e.g., Vercel deployment status in Story 1.1).
*   **Documentation Alignment Traceability:** A discrepancy was noted between the granular Acceptance Criteria in Story 1.2 and the high-level Epic 1 Technical Specification, highlighting a need for better alignment and traceability across planning artifacts.

---

## 4. Key Insights & Learnings

*   **External Dependencies as Critical Blockers:** External factors, such as repository ownership or third-party service access, can become critical path blockers, necessitating flexible adaptation strategies and clear fallback plans.
*   **Importance of Internal Verification:** Thorough internal verification of foundational components is crucial, especially when external verification is challenging or impossible. This ensures the team is building on a stable base.
*   **Continuous Documentation Alignment:** Consistent review and updating of planning artifacts (from PRD to stories) are vital to maintain traceability and prevent misunderstandings as the project evolves.

## 5. Next Epic Preview: Epic 2 - User Onboarding & Profile Management

**Goal:** Allow students to create an account, log in, and manage their personal and CV information.
**Dependencies on Epic 1:** Epic 2 heavily relies on the foundational monorepo setup and the robust Supabase integration from Epic 1 for user authentication and data management.

**Concerns / Preparation Needed for Epic 2:**
*   The CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment is currently blocked due to external factors, which could impact the ease of deploying and testing Epic 2 features in integrated environments.
*   The team needs to explicitly solidify and verify Supabase integration (removing temporary bypasses) before building user-facing features on it.

---

## 6. Action Items & Commitments

**A. Process Improvements:**
1.  **Finalize and Document Supabase Integration:** Remove all temporary bypasses related to Story 1.3's initial halt and ensure the backend Supabase client is fully operational and validated.
    *   Owner: Charlie
    *   Deadline: Before Epic 2 kickoff
    *   Success Criteria: Backend Supabase client fully operational, no bypasses in `backend/app/main.py` or `supabase_client.py`.

2.  **Establish Local Supabase Environment Variable Management:** Create and document a clear process for developers to manage local Supabase credentials and environment variables.
    *   Owner: Charlie/Amelia
    *   Deadline: Before Epic 2 kickoff
    *   Success Criteria: Clear, written guidelines available for local Supabase setup.

3.  **Review and Update Epic 1 Tech Spec Traceability:** Update the Epic 1 Tech Spec to improve traceability, either by including granular story Acceptance Criteria or explicitly delegating them to the individual stories.
    *   Owner: Bob (Scrum Master)
    *   Deadline: Before Epic 2 planning
    *   Success Criteria: Epic 1 Tech Spec accurately reflects or links to detailed story ACs.

**B. Preparation Tasks for Epic 2:**
1.  **Implement E2E Test for Supabase:** Create a single, passing End-to-End test for user creation/retrieval against the locally configured Supabase instance.
    *   Owner: Dana/Charlie
    *   Deadline: Before Epic 2 kickoff
    *   Success Criteria: Automated test confirms end-to-end Supabase connection and basic user creation functionality.

**C. Critical Path Items (Must complete before Epic 2):**
1.  Finalize and validate Supabase integration by removing bypasses and ensuring proper local configuration.
2.  Implement a basic E2E test to confirm end-to-end user creation/retrieval via Supabase.

**D. Team Agreements:**
*   Prioritize local functionality and local verification while the CI/CD pipeline remains externally blocked.
*   Address the identified critical preparation tasks immediately before commencing work on Epic 2.

---

## 7. Readiness Assessment for Epic 1

*   **Testing & Quality:** Needs verification.
    *   **Action needed:** Implement and pass E2E test for Supabase user creation/retrieval.
*   **Deployment:** Local only. Not needed for immediate next steps.
*   **Internal Team Satisfaction:** Satisfied with the foundational code and direction.
*   **Technical Health:** Internal codebase considered stable, but external factors (CI/CD blocker) introduce overall system fragility.
*   **Unresolved Blockers:** Finalization of Supabase connection (critical path item). Story 1.3 (CI/CD) deferred due to external repo ownership.

---

## 8. Significant Discovery Alert & Next Steps

**Significant Changes Identified:**
1.  External blocker (repo ownership) caused deferral of Story 1.3 (CI/CD pipeline), impacting deployment verification.
2.  Critical need to explicitly solidify and verify Supabase integration (removing bypasses) before starting Epic 2.
3.  Discrepancy/traceability issue between story-level Acceptance Criteria and Epic 1 Tech Spec needs addressing for future planning clarity.

**Impact on Epic 2:**
The current plan for Epic 2 assumes a fully stable and locally verifiable Supabase integration, and a more streamlined deployment process. These assumptions are impacted by the findings from Epic 1.

**Recommended Actions:**
*   **Epic Update Required**: YES - Schedule epic planning review session.
*   **Dedicated Preparation Phase:** A focused preparation phase (prep sprint) is required before commencing Epic 2.

---

**Commitments Made:**

*   Action Items: 3
*   Preparation Tasks: 1
*   Critical Path Items: 2

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Execute Preparation Sprint:**
    *   Complete 2 critical path items: (1) Supabase finalization, (2) E2E test.
    *   Execute 1 preparation task: E2E test.
    *   Verify all action items are in progress.
2.  **Review action items in next standup:** Ensure ownership is clear, track progress, adjust timelines.
3.  **IMPORTANT: Schedule Epic 2 planning review session:** Review and update affected stories, align team on revised approach. **Do NOT start Epic 2 until this review is complete.**

---

**Team Performance Summary:**
Epic 1 delivered 2 completed stories, establishing a robust technical foundation. The retrospective surfaced 3 key insights and identified significant discoveries requiring a focused preparation phase for Epic 2. The team demonstrated adaptability in navigating external blockers and commitment to quality.
