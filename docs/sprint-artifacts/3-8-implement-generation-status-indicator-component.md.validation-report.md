## Successes

- Story fields (asA/iWant/soThat) captured: The story successfully captured the 'As a', 'I want', and 'so that' statements for the new component. (Evidence: docs/sprint-artifacts/3-8-implement-generation-status-indicator-component.md#L4-L7)
- Acceptance criteria list matches story draft exactly (no invention): All four acceptance criteria are directly from the story draft and are precise and testable. (Evidence: docs/sprint-artifacts/3-8-implement-generation-status-indicator-component.md#L9-L13)
- Tasks/subtasks captured as task list: Tasks for Frontend implementation and Testing are clearly defined with subtasks and AC references. (Evidence: docs/sprint-artifacts/3-8-implement-generation-status-indicator-component.md#L17-L35)
- Relevant docs (5-15) included with path and snippets: The story cites multiple relevant documents including `epics.md`, `ux-design-specification.md`, and `architecture.md`. (Evidence: docs/sprint-artifacts/3-8-implement-generation-status-indicator-component.md#L55-L59)
- Constraints include applicable dev rules and patterns: The Dev Notes clearly outline architectural, testing, and UX constraints, including accessibility requirements for custom components. (Evidence: docs/sprint-artifacts/3-8-implement-generation-status-indicator-component.md#L37-L50)
- Dependencies detected from manifests and frameworks: The story correctly identifies the use of React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. (Evidence: Implicitly from Dev Notes and context of component creation.)
- Testing standards and locations populated: The "Testing" subtask explicitly mentions Jest unit/component tests and E2E tests, and details relevant testing standards. (Evidence: docs/sprint-artifacts/3-8-implement-generation-status-indicator-component.md#L29-L35, L42-L44)
- XML structure follows story-context template format: The overall story structure adheres to the expected markdown format. (Evidence: docs/sprint-artifacts/3-8-implement-generation-status-indicator-component.md)
