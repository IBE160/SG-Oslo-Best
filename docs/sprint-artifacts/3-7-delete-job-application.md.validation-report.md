(Evidence: docs/sprint-artifacts/3-7-delete-job-application.md#L62-L70)
- All relevant source docs discovered and cited: The story correctly cites `docs/epics.md#Story-3.7`, `docs/PRD.md#FR-2.3`, `docs/architecture.md#API-Contracts`, `docs/architecture.md#Implementation-Patterns`, and `docs/ux-design-specification.md#Confirmation-Patterns`. (Evidence: docs/sprint-artifacts/3-7-delete-job-application.md#L55-L60)

- Dev Notes have specific guidance with citations (not generic): The Dev Notes provide specific architectural, testing, and UX considerations with relevant citations. (Evidence: docs/sprint-artifacts/3-7-delete-job-application.md#L37-L49)

The file is in the correct location. (Evidence: docs/sprint-artifacts/3-7-delete-job-application.md#L2-L10, L72-L84)
