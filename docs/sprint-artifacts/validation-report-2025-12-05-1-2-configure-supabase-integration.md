### 2. Previous Story Continuity Check
**Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)**
[✓] The story correctly identifies the previous story (`1-1-initialize-project-repositories-structure`) and its `done` status.
[✓] The "Learnings from Previous Story" section accurately captures key outcomes, including the creation of `.env.example` files, correction of an architectural mismatch, and the unresolved risk regarding Vercel deployment verification.
[✓] The citation for the previous story has been updated to a formal `[Source: docs/sprint-artifacts/1-1-initialize-project-repositories-structure.md]` format for consistency.

### 3. Source Document Coverage Check
**Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)**
[✓] The story correctly identifies and cites all relevant, existing source documents, including `architecture.md`, `epics.md`, and `tech-spec-epic-1.md`.
[✓] All citations are valid and point to existing files with appropriate section/story references.

### 4. Acceptance Criteria Quality Check
**Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)**
[✓] The story contains 5 clear, testable, and specific Acceptance Criteria.
[✓] The `Dev Notes` section proactively identifies and documents a discrepancy between the story's granular ACs and the high-level ACs in the epic's tech spec, providing a clear resolution path. This demonstrates excellent awareness and adherence to the principle of traceability.

### 5. Task-AC Mapping Check
**Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)**
[✓] All Acceptance Criteria are clearly mapped to corresponding tasks.
[✓] All tasks reference the ACs they fulfill.
[✓] Comprehensive testing subtasks (`[Test]`) are included, covering all ACs and implementation steps.

### 6. Dev Notes Quality Check
**Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)**
[✓] All required subsections are present (`Architecture patterns and constraints`, `References`, `Learnings from Previous Story`).
[✓] The guidance provided is specific and actionable (e.g., specifying `service_role` vs. `anon` keys).

### 8. Unresolved Review Items Alert
**Pass Rate: 1/1 (100%)**
