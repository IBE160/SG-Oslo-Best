# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-10-26
**Facilitator:** Mary, Business Analyst
**Participant:** BIP

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** "CVAI Turbo" application proposal

**Session Goals:** Identify any aspects of the application that haven't been considered in the proposal.

**Techniques Used:** Six Thinking Hats

**Total Ideas Generated:** 15+

### Key Themes Identified:

- **MVP First**: A strong focus on delivering the core value proposition simply and effectively.
- **Phased AI Integration**: A strategic approach to introduce AI features over time, starting with an "AI-lite" version to mitigate risks and user hesitation.
- **Skill-Building vs. Automation**: A core tension to manage, ensuring the tool empowers users rather than making them dependent.
- **Data Privacy & Ethics**: Critical considerations for handling sensitive user data and building trust.

## Technique Sessions

### Six Thinking Hats

_A detailed summary of the points raised under each hat is included below._

## Idea Categorization

### Immediate Opportunities

- **Develop an "AI-lite" MVP**: Instead of full AI generation, start with high-value, low-risk features like cover letter templates, tone/style presets, and keyword matching from the job description.
- **Focus on Skill-Building**: Implement features like "Explain this" to teach writing principles and show AI suggestions alongside a user's draft for comparison and learning.

### Future Innovations

- **Full AI Integration**: Introduce the full, third-party LLM-based cover letter generation as a future phase.
- **Expanded Features**: Consider adding adaptive tone templates, skill-match analysis, voice input, and integration with job boards.

### Moonshots

- A version of the tool that generates creative works (poems, stories) based on a CV, not just cover letters.

### Insights and Learnings

- The user's hesitation about immediate, full AI integration is a critical insight that reshapes the project roadmap.
- The most valuable version of this tool may be one that assists and teaches, rather than one that fully automates.
- Balancing user empowerment with the power of AI is the central design challenge.

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Create a Product Brief for the "AI-Lite" MVP

- **Rationale**: This aligns with the key insights from the session and provides a clear, achievable starting point that mitigates many of the risks identified.
- **Next steps**: Draft a formal product brief based on the AI-lite concept, focusing on templates, keyword analysis, and skill-building features.
- **Resources needed**: Time for product definition and stakeholder review.
- **Timeline**: 1-2 days.

#### #2 Priority: Define Data Privacy Protocol

- **Rationale**: Address the critical data privacy risks early in the process.
- **Next steps**: Document a clear protocol for handling user data, including anonymization for any future AI use and data deletion procedures.
- **Resources needed**: Technical and legal review.
- **Timeline**: Ongoing, to be completed before development starts.

#### #3 Priority: Map User Skill-Building Journey

- **Rationale**: To ensure the tool empowers users, the educational aspect needs to be designed intentionally.
- **Next steps**: Storyboard how a user learns about good cover letter writing through the tool's features.
- **Resources needed**: UX/UI design resources.
- **Timeline**: 1 week.

## Reflection and Follow-up

### What Worked Well

- The Six Thinking Hats method was highly effective at surfacing not just ideas, but also the critical risks, emotions, and creative solutions associated with the project.

### Areas for Further Exploration

- Deeper analysis of competitor tools that may already exist.
- User research to validate the appeal of an "AI-lite" tool versus a fully automated one.

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

- **Product Brief**: Formalize the AI-lite MVP concept.
- **Research**: Investigate the competitive landscape.

### Questions That Emerged

- How do we measure "skill-building"?
- What is the exact threshold for when full AI integration becomes the right choice?
