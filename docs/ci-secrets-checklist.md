# CI Secrets Checklist for CVAI Turbo

This document lists the essential secrets that need to be configured in your CI/CD platform (GitHub Actions) for the pipeline to function correctly, especially when interacting with external services or protected environments.

**It is CRITICAL that these secrets are never hardcoded into your repository. Always use your CI platform's secure secret management features.**

## 🔑 GitHub Actions Secrets Configuration

These secrets should be added to your GitHub repository settings under:
`Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > Repository secrets`

### Required Secrets for Test Execution

When running end-to-end tests against a deployed or staging environment, the tests will need access to the application's base URLs and potentially authentication credentials.

*   **`BASE_URL`**: The base URL of the frontend application under test (e.g., `https://your-app-staging.vercel.app`).
    *   **Purpose:** Allows Playwright tests to navigate to the correct application instance.
*   **`API_URL`**: The base URL of the backend API under test (e.g., `https://your-api-staging.vercel.app/api/v1`).
    *   **Purpose:** Used by data factories or API tests to make direct calls to the backend.
*   **`TEST_USER_EMAIL`**: (Optional, but recommended for authenticated tests) The email of a pre-provisioned test user.
    *   **Purpose:** Allows tests to log in and test authenticated user flows.
*   **`TEST_USER_PASSWORD`**: (Optional, but recommended) The password for the `TEST_USER_EMAIL`.
    *   **Purpose:** Complementary to `TEST_USER_EMAIL` for login.

### Optional Secrets for Notifications

If you wish to receive notifications (e.g., Slack, Teams) on pipeline failures, you will need to configure the relevant webhook URL.

*   **`SLACK_WEBHOOK`**: The webhook URL for your Slack channel.
    *   **Purpose:** Enables Slack notifications for CI pipeline status updates, especially on failures.

### Best Practices for Secrets

*   **Least Privilege:** Only grant the necessary permissions to the CI pipeline.
*   **Rotation:** Regularly rotate your secrets, especially API keys.
*   **Environment-Specific:** Consider having different sets of secrets for different environments (e.g., `STAGING_API_URL`, `PRODUCTION_API_URL`).
*   **Never Log:** Ensure that secrets are never logged in plain text in your CI output.
