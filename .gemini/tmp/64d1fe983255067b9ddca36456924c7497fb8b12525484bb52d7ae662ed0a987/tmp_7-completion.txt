Story 2-4: Update User Profile & CV with Hybrid Save is complete and ready for review, BIP.

Key Accomplishments:
- Implemented a hybrid save model for user profile and CV editing, allowing auto-save on blur and manual save for all fields.
- Integrated React Query for efficient data fetching and mutation handling.
- Added an "Unsaved changes..." indicator using React Context.
- Implemented a navigation blocker with a confirmation modal for unsaved changes.
- Enhanced the backend PATCH /api/v1/users/me/cv endpoint to handle partial updates of all user profile and CV fields.
- Ensured correct updated_at timestamping with UTC timezone in the backend.
- Implemented server-side validation for empty fields in the PATCH endpoint.

Tests:
- New comprehensive API tests for the PATCH /api/v1/users/me/cv endpoint.
- Extended E2E tests for profile-cv.spec.ts to cover hybrid save functionality, validation, and navigation blocker.
