- Never written a cover letter for a spesific job application.
- No relevant work experience that can relate to the type of job.
- Straight form college as a student and not worker.
- Bad experience from getting decline from other jobs.
- Do not know the company/organization they are applying for a job.
- The students are new to the working market.
