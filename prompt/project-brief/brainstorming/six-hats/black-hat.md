The downsides of CVAI Turbo:
1. It may face issues such as AI hallucinated or biased content.
2. Privacy risks from handling personal data like CVs and contact details.
3. Students might become over-reliant on automation, reducing their own writing and critical thinking skills. 
4. Institutions could raise ethical or integrity concerns about AI-generated applications. 
5. Technical challenges include data parsing errors, security vulnerabilities, and tight development timelines. 
6. Adding AI integration later on would be challenging.

Without careful design and safeguards, the tool could produce generic or misleading cover letters and face compliance or trust issues.
