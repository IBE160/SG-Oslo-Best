### Must Have (MVP)
Keep it simple, stupid! Like the KISS paradigm, the goal is to help students save time and effort when writing their cover letters.
- Create update, delete for CV only one (plain text)
  - Sub-part of CV is a profile.
  - A textbox where the user can put instructions (here option for style and tone).
- Create update, delete job application
  - Job advertisement as plain text
- Cover letter will be generated by third party LLM.


### Risk mitigation, nice to have
**AI Bias & Hallucination**: Use human review and editing before saving.

**User Privacy**: Keep all data in Supabase with RLS, anonymize personal info before AI use, and allow users to delete data anytime.

**Future feature**:
- The tool might include adaptive tone templates, skill-match analysis, and integration with job boards for seamless applications. 
- Features like voice input, and feedback loops would boost engagement, accessibility, and continuous learning, making CVAI Turbo both practical and educational.
- It could guide students step-by-step, give feedback, and suggest improvements to their CV and writing.
