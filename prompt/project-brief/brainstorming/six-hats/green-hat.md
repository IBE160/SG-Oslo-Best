Keep it simple, stupid! Like the KISS paradigm, the goal is to help students save time and effort when writing their cover letters.
### Must Have (MVP)
- Create update, delete for CV only one (plain text)
  - Sub-part of CV is a profile.
  - A textbox where the user can put instructions (here option for style and tone).
- Create update, delete job application
  - Job advertisement as plain text
- Cover letter will be generated by third party LLM.

### Risk mitigation 
**AI Bias & Hallucination**: Use human review and editing before saving. Add bias filters and show prompts transparently to help users understand AI choices.

**User Privacy**: Keep all data in Supabase with RLS, anonymize personal info before AI use, and allow users to delete data anytime.

**Skill-Building over Reliance**: Add “Explain this” and feedback modes so students learn writing principles. Show AI output beside the user’s draft for comparison.

**AI-lite / Non-AI Option**: Start with templates, tone presets, and keyword matching instead of full AI generation—letting users practice writing while keeping the tool simple and private.

**(Secondary)** The tool might include adaptive tone templates, skill-match analysis, and integration with job boards for seamless applications. 

**(Secondary)** Features like voice input, and feedback loops would boost engagement, accessibility, and continuous learning, making CVAI Turbo both practical and educational.

**(Secondary)** It could guide students step-by-step, give feedback, and suggest improvements to their CV and writing.
