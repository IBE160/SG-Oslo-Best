Students are often new to the job application process, and many find it difficult to know how or where to start when writing a cover letter. They may be unsure about how long the letter should be or what information it should include. In addition, students often feel that they lack strong writing skills or struggle to highlight their most relevant experiences effectively. The idea is to develop an AI-based tool that assists students by taking their CV, job application, and specific instructions as input, and generating a customized cover letter as output. The tool can either provide a relevant template or produce a finalized, ready-to-use cover letter. A successful application would provide students with a tool that supports and motivates them to apply for the jobs they truly want.

I'am not sure that I want to integrate AI right away, but rather do it over time/ in next phase.
